# Boulder Bash (Visual Overview) 
This repository provides an overview of my contributions to the **Boulder Bash** team project, inspired by the classic Boulder Dash game. 
## Project Overview 
**Boulder Bash** is a tile-based strategy game featuring: 
- Dynamic enemy AI (butterflies, fireflies, frogs)
- Player navigation through destructible terrain
- Saving and loading functionality for game progress
## My Contributions 
- Developed general logic for enemy behaviours:
  - **Butterfly**: Moves in a predictable pattern and avoids obstacles.
  - **Frog**: Tracks the player.
  - **Firefly**: Moves randomly across the grid, adding unpredictability.
  - Designed systems for enemy movement and grid integration.
  - Collaborated with teammates on debugging and final testing.
  - Aided in designing game visuals.
## Diagrams and Visuals in the repository are diagrams and screenshots demonstrating my work on the enemy system.
